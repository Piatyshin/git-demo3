You create misery
Have your cake and eat it
Take your place in history
And pray we don't repeat it
Call it fate, call it back
Call it off, don't call me later
Lay your head in your bed
It's just how you made it

Out of my way, I'm running
I'm gonna catch you if I can
Out of my way, I'm coming
I'm gonna catch you if I can
Out of my way, I'm running
I'm gonna catch you if I can
Out of my way, start running
I'm gonna catch you
