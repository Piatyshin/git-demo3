You create misery
Have your cake and eat it
Take your place in history
And pray we don't repeat it
Call it fate, call it back
Call it off, don't call me later
Lay your head in your bed
It's just how you made it

Out of my way, I'm running
I'm gonna catch you if I can
Out of my way, I'm coming
I'm gonna catch you if I can
Out of my way, I'm running
I'm gonna catch you if I can
Out of my way, start running
I'm gonna catch you

It's your day, believe it
It's your date with destiny
It's too late to leave it
After all it's your, it's your party
Call it luck, call it fate
Call me beautiful to my face
Call it off, to my surprise
It's just how you made it

Out of my way, I'm running
I'm gonna catch you if I can
Out of my way, I'm coming
I'm gonna catch you if I can
Out of my way, I'm running
I'm gonna catch you if I can
Out of my way, start running
I'm gonna catch you
